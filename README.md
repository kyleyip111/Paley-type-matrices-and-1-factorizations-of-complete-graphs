# Paley-type-matrices-and-1-factorizations-of-complete-graphs


This code is supplementary material for the paper "Paley-type matrices and 1-factorizations of complete graphs" Semin Yoo and Chi Hoi Yip.

For each of the primes $p\leq 9.2 \times 10^7$ with $p \equiv 1 \pmod 8$, the code output the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ and $a(a^2-a+1)$ is a nonzero fourth power modulo $p$. Each row of the output file has the form $(p,a)$.
